# Tamtamelite Travel Blog

This repository contains the static files for a simple travel blog website. The site showcases a modern UI/UX design built with HTML5 and CSS3. JavaScript adds interactivity for the contact form, mobile navigation, and a "back to top" button. The design uses CSS variables for easy theming and responsive layouts.

Open `index.html` in a browser to preview the site.

## Customizing

All colors are defined in `css/style.css` using CSS variables. Adjust `--primary-color` and `--accent-color` to change the theme.
